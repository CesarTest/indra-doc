## Air Traffic Management (ATM)
 
Air Traffic Management System (ATM) is a complex system that integrates 
many different subsystems to allow central air traffic control
in coherent and compact way.

## Air Navigation Services (ANS)

ATM is the computational layer that coordinates the entire communications infrastructure that connects all the subsystems. It stores critical data that must be managed in real time to transform it into useful information for the ANS (Air Navigation Services) layer, the services that guide the decision-making of the different responsible agents.
